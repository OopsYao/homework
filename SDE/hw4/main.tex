    Since
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \var(X_t)&=E(X_t^2)-(E(X_t))^2\\
        &=E\left\{\left(\int_0^tW_s\diff s\right)
        \left(\int_0^tW_r\diff r\right)\right\}\\
        &=E\left(\int_0^t\int_0^tW_sW_r\diff s\diff r\right)\\
        &=\int_\Omega\left(\iint_{[0,t]^2}W_sW_r\diff s\diff r\right)\diff P
    \end{aligned}\]
    then we apply Fubini theorem again,
    \[\var(X_t)=\iint_{[0,t]^2}
    \left(\int_\Omega W_sW_r\diff P\right)\diff s\diff r\]
    Without loss of generality, assume that $s<r$, then we obtain
    by inpendent increments of Brownian motion,
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \int_\Omega W_sW_r\diff P&=E(W_sW_r)\\
        &=E(W_s(W_r-W_s+W_s))\\
        &=E(W_s(W_r-W_s))+E(W_s^2)\\
        &=s
    \end{aligned}\]
    thus in general,
    \[\int_\Omega W_sW_r\diff P=\min\{s,r\}\]
    It follows that
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \var(X_t)&=\iint_{[0,t]^2}\min\{s,r\}\diff s\diff r\\
        &=\left(\iint_{\{(s,r)\in[0,t]^2;s\leq r\}}
                +\iint_{\{(s,r)\in[0,t]^2;s\leq r\}}\right)
        \min\{s,r\}\diff s\diff r\\
    \end{aligned}\]
    and by symmetry, we obtain the variance as
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \var(X_t)&=2\iint_{\{(s,r)\in[0,t]^2;s\leq r\}}s\diff s\diff r\\
        &=\int_0^t\diff r\int_0^r2s\diff s\\
        &=\frac{t^3}{3}
    \end{aligned}\]

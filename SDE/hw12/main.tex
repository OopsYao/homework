    \item See \cref{fig:GBM}.
    \item Since $E(f(t,W_t))=\exp((\alpha+\beta^2/2)t)$, we can
    plot it directly. As we can see in \cref{fig:GBM},
    $f(t,W_t)$ is oscillating around its expectation.
    Compare the two path with same $\alpha,\beta$, we can
    get an intuitive impression of the variation, and it
    it easy to find that
    greater $\beta$ means a greater variation.
    Similarly, compare different $\alpha$ with same $\beta$,
    we can conclude that $\alpha$ has a significant impact on 
    the trend of the curve.

        since uniform random event comparison is not so interesting -- it
        is similar to the deterministic case.}

\problem
We can see from \cref{tab:diff} that the error tends to 0 as $N$ goes large.

        $k$ & error \\

        $2^{4}$ & $0.26219$\\
        $2^{6}$ & $0.05478$\\
        $2^{8}$ & $0.04009$\\

\problem
As we can see in \cref{fig:num}, in general,
the curves are oscillating around $b=10$, and bigger $\sigma$ means
more violent disturbation.
Compare the Vasicek and CIR model we see that, in general,
the curve of the former varies in a smaller range.

    \problem
    Denote
    \[A_t:=-\int_0^tg(s)\diff W_s+\frac{1}{2}\int_0^tg^2(s)\diff s\]
    then $A_t$ is an It\^o process as
    \[\diff A_t=-g(t)\diff W_t+\frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\diff t\]
    hence
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \diff I_t&=\diff \e^{A_t}\\
        &=\e^{A_t}\left(\diff A_t+\frac{1}{2}(\diff A_t)^2\right)\\
        &=\e^{A_t}(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)\\
        &=I_t(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)
    \end{aligned}\]
    It follows that
    \[\diff I_t\diff X_t=-\e^{A_t}g^2(t)X_t\diff t=-I_tX_tg^2(t)\diff t\]
    therefore,
    \[\begin{aligned}
        &\diff(I_tX_t)\\
        =&I_t\diff X_t+X_t\diff I_t+\diff I_t\diff X_t\\
        =&I_tf(t,X_t)\diff t+I_tg(t)\diff W_t+I_tX_t(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)
        -I_tX_tg^2(t)\diff t\\
        =&I_tf(t,X_t)\diff t
    \end{aligned}\]

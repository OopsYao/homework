    \problem
    Denote
    \[A_t:=-\int_0^tg(s)\diff W_s+\frac{1}{2}\int_0^tg^2(s)\diff s\]
    then $A_t$ is an It\^o process as
    \[\diff A_t=-g(t)\diff W_t+\frac{1}{2}g^2(t)\diff t\]
    hence
    \[\begin{aligned}
        \diff I_t&=\diff \e^{A_t}\\
        &=\e^{A_t}\left(\diff A_t+\frac{1}{2}(\diff A_t)^2\right)\\
        &=\e^{A_t}(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)\\
        &=I_t(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)
    \end{aligned}\]
    It follows that
    \[\diff I_t\diff X_t=-\e^{A_t}g^2(t)X_t\diff t=-I_tX_tg^2(t)\diff t\]
    therefore,
    \[\begin{aligned}
        &\diff(I_tX_t)\\
        =&I_t\diff X_t+X_t\diff I_t+\diff I_t\diff X_t\\
        =&I_tf(t,X_t)\diff t+I_tg(t)\diff W_t+I_tX_t(-g(t)\diff W_t+g^2(t)\diff t)
        -I_tX_tg^2(t)\diff t\\
        =&I_tf(t,X_t)\diff t
    \end{aligned}\]

    \problem
    \begin{subproblem}[(\alph*)]
        \item
        We have that
        \[f(t,X_t)=0,g(t)=\alpha\]
        thus
        \[I_t=\e^{-\alpha W_t+\alpha^2t/2}\]
        and
        \[\diff(I_tX_t)=0\]
        which gives us
        \[I_tX_t=I_0X_0=X_0\]
        i.e.,
        \[X_t=\frac{X_0}{I_t}=X_0\e^{\alpha W_t-\alpha^2t/2}\]

        \item
        $I_t$ and following ones are the same as above
        since $g(t)=\alpha$ is not changed.
        And we have that $f(t,X_t)=r$, hence
        \[\diff(I_tX_t)=rI_t\diff t\]
        Therefore,
        \[\begin{aligned}
            X_t&=I_t^{-1}\left(I_0X_0+r\int_0^tI_s\diff s\right)\\
            &=X_0\e^{\alpha W_t-\alpha^2/t}+r\int_0^t\e^{\alpha(W_t-W_s)-\alpha^2(t-s)/2}\diff s
        \end{aligned}\]

        \item
        We have that $f(t,X_t)=X_t$, thus
        \[\diff(I_tX_t)=I_tX_t\diff t\]
        Therefore,
        \[I_tX_t=I_0X_0\e^t=X_0\e^t\]
        as the quadratic variation
        \[\diff(I_t^2X_t^2)=0\]
        i.e.,
        \[X_t=X_0\e^{\alpha W_t-(\alpha^2/2-1)t}\]

        \item
        We have that $f(t,X_t)=1/X_t$, thus
        \[\diff Y_t=\diff(I_tX_t)=\frac{I_t\diff t}{X_t}
        =\frac{I_t^2\diff t}{Y_t}\]
        i.e.,
        \[Y_t\diff Y_t=I_t^2\diff t\]
        Therefore,
        \[\int_0^tY_s\diff Y_s=\frac{Y_t^2-Y_0^2}{2}=\int_0^tI_s^2\diff s\]
        i.e.,
        % TODO X0 > 0 cancels minus sign ?
        \[\begin{aligned}
            X_t&=\pm I_t^{-1}\sqrt{Y_0^2+2\int_0^tI_s^2\diff s}\\
            &=\pm\sqrt{X_0^2\e^{2\alpha W_t-\alpha^2t}
            +2\int_0^t\e^{-2\alpha(W_s-W_t)+\alpha^2(s-t)}\diff s}
        \end{aligned}\]

    \end{subproblem}
